Design Analysis And Algorithms by Ujjwal Chauhan

Week 3:

Question 1.
   Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and a program to sort the 
   array using insertion sort. Your program should be able to find number of comparisons 
   and shifts ( shifts - total number of times the array elements are shifted from their 
   place) required for sorting the array.

   Input Format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there 
   will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains 
   space-separated integers describing array.
   
   Output Format: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, there will 
   be three output lines. First line will give the sorted array. Second line will give total 
   number of comparisons. Third line will give total number of shift operations required.
   
Question 2.
   Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement a program to 
   sort this array using selection sort. Your program should also find number of 
   comparisons and number of swaps required.

   Input Format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there 
   will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains 
   space-separated integers describing array.
   
   Output Format: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, there will 
   be three output lines. First line will give the sorted array. Second line will give total 
   number of comparisons. Third line will give total number of swaps required.

Question 3.
   Given an unsorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it 
   using a program to find whether there are any duplicate elements in the array or not. 
   (use sorting) (Time Complexity = O(n log n))
   
   Input Format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there 
   will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains 
   space-separated integers describing array.
   
   Output Format: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case, output will 
   be 'YES' if duplicates are present otherwise ‘NO’.
