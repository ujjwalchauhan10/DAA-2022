Design Analysis And Algorithms by Ujjwal Chauhan

Week 2:
Question 1. 
   Given a sorted array of positive integers containing few duplicate elements, design an algorithm 
   and implement it using a program to find whether the given key element is present in the array or 
   not. If present, then also find the number of copies of given key. (Time Complexity = O(log n))
   
   Input format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be three 
   input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers 
   describing array. Third line contains the key element that need to be searched in the array.

   Output format: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, output will be the key 
   element and its number of copies in the array if the key element is present in the array otherwise 
   print “ Key not present”. 
   
   
Question 2. 
   Given a sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program 
   to find three indices i, j, k such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k]. 

   Input format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be two 
   input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers 
   describing array.
   
   Output: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, print the value of i, j and k, if 
   found else print “No sequence found”.

   
Question 3.
   Given an array of nonnegative integers, design an algorithm and a program to count the number 
   of pairs of integers such that their difference is equal to a given key, K. 
   
   Input format: The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be three 
   input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers 
   describing array. Third line contains the key element.
   
   Output format: The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, output will be the total 
   count i.e. number of times such pair exists
